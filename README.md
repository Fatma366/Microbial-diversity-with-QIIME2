# Microbial-diversity-with-QIIME2

•	Microbial diversity in coconut leaves associated with the lethal yellowing disease symptoms in coastal Kenya

•	Qiime2 is one of the latest bioinformatics tools used in microbial diversity analysis.

•	For set up and installation of QIIME2 use the link: [Set Up And Installation (QIIME2)](https://github.com/Fatma366/16S-rRNA-End-to-End-Analysis#set-up-and-installation-qiime2)

•	For tutorials involving QIIME2 use the link: [QIIME2 Analysis](https://github.com/Fatma366/16S-rRNA-End-to-End-Analysis#qiime2-analysis)


•	The analysis involves the following steps: Included in the Microbial-Qiime2-analysis.sh and the last step in sample-classifier.sh

•	Importing data to qiime2

•	Demultiplexing allows you to determine how many sequences were obtained per sample

•	Denoising, truncating and quality control using dada2

•	Feature Table and Feature Data Summary

•	Phylogenetic Tree Construction

•	Visualization of the tree, though the tree will have features ID as the names, not so informative

•	Alpha Rarefraction Plotting

•	Alpha Diversity Analysis

•	Beta Diversity Analysis

•	Beta Group Significance Analysis (PERMANOVA)

•	Taxonomic Analysis: Download the trained naive Bayes classifier for the v4 hypervariable region

•	Predicting categorical sample data with machine learning classifiers
